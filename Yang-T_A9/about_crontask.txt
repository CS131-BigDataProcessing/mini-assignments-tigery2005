a) 2 other jobs that cron is useful for are to perform regular service checks (verifying critical services are still running smoothly and to restart them if needed) and regular security scans (schedule antivirus and antimalware checks).
b) Poorly managed automated tasks can cause resource overload when scheduled at coinciding times. Tasks that do not properly report their logs can fail without being noticed. Unchecked loops can break critical system applications. To avoid these risks, regualarly create backups and verify that they are functional. Keep a timetable of regular tasks and avoid scheduling them at similar times. Always test scipts manually before assigning them regularly using cron.
